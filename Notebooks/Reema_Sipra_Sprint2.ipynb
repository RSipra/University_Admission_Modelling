    "One of the biggest decision points for students and their parents is picking a suitable university and career. People spend considerable resources to pick and get into the right university. With increasing educational costs and facing an increasingly competitive job market after graduation, making an informed decision is even more crtical for prospective students and their families.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to making an informed decision is relevant data that is presented in a useful manner. There is a wealth of information provided by govrenmental institutions and universities that can be analyzed through machine learning models to support such desicion making. Leveraging techniques such as time series analysis through AutoRegressive (AR) models and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between these variables and future financial success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, these models have the potential to also support university with their strategies by enabling them to tailor their programs to better align with the financial expectations of students and enhance overall educational outcomes. It can also support diversification of the student body.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Objectives:**\n",
    "The objectives of the project have been updated to the following since Sprint-1:\n",
    "- Support decision making of high school students & parents.\n",
    "- Create a reliable model for students to estimate earnings for given program and university.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook (Sprint-2) Objectives:**\n",
    "The objectives of this notebook are to:\n",
    "- Create a dataframe with the necessary features for a bottom-up modelling approach.\n",
    "- Setup the data for modelling.\n",
    "- Perform preliminary EDA on the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Highlevel methodology**:\n",
    "This will entail time series modelling of the projected earning based on selected key features. The key features will be determined through EDA and modelling iteratively through a bottom-up approach. For advanced modelling, Convolutional Nueral Networks can be considered as they are also used for time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important notes on work progression** since *Initial Data Exploration (Sprint 1):*\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any real world project, for this Capstone project there are updates, modifications, and revisits to the drawing board as the understanding of the problem space has grown. This is common in the early-stages of a project. It is important to front-load project modifications in the initial or conceptual stage of the project to clarify the scope and approah where the impact on the cost with respect to time and resources is considerably less compared to later stages (e.g. modelling, evaluation, deployment phases). The key modifications since Sprint-1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Title, Intent, and objective of the project**: The original intent was to predict enrollment of students into universities and this has been changed to a time series analysis of projected earnings e.g. for a given program / university etc combination.\n",
    "2. **Methodology, EDA & modelling approach**: Originally models such as logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks were considered. Based on the changes in objectives, the approach has been altered in line with the 'Highlevel methodlogy' outlined earlier.\n",
    "3. **Update of the Initial Data Exploration (sprint-1) notebook** inline with updates to the project."
