## Data source: 
US Department of Education, College Scorecard (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)

**College Scorecard:** An online tool created by the US government to allow users to compare the cost and value of higher institutional learning. Includes data on Title IV Universities (receive federal funding to make tuition affordable).
Initiated by President Obama to: " be able to see how much each school's graduates earn, how much debt they graduate with, and what percentage of a school's students can pay back their loans." 

**Three main components:** 
 - Institutional level data: (6543 universities, 15 categories, 3232 columns) over 26 years.
 - Fields of study at the universities (233,979 study areas, 160 columns) over 6 years.
 - Crosswalks:  map of differing institutional data defintion between university and the federal government (25004 records, 21 columns) over 20 years.
